Use logarithmic eigenvals representaiton, 
fit with a low order polynomial for below i = 300 and above.
use the fits to produce a "weiner filter"
Then approximate the weiner filter with a reverse sin() version of the erf()... e.g. 1 if i<icen-w;0 if i>icen+w; otherwise 0.5*( 1.-sin(pi/2*(i-icen)/w) )
this icen+w is also where we truncate the eigvecs, beyond this is out of signal.
